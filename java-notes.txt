java
it is a simple language provides security and robust(strong) high performance language
we need jdk in that jre will be there in that jvm will be there 
our .java code is converted to .class code using compiler which is platform independent and that .class code is converted into machine .byte code using jvm which is platform dependent.


variables 
local 
static - memory allocation happens when the class is loaded in the memory

data types 
primitive - which are predefined 
int4 byte1 short2 char1 long8 double8 float4 boolean1
non primitive - user defined
class string arrays

enum - is a special data type which is used to define our own variables
eg: 

enum Days{
Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday}

public class Demo
{
Days d = Days.Monday;
sysout(d); // prints monday
switch (Days)
{
case Monday:
{
sysout("its monday");
break;
}
}
}


opeartors

unary - pre,post ++,--
binary - assignment,arithmatic,logical,bitwise,ternary,relational

Static - dont need to create an object for it, can directly call with its class name
Main - this is where execution of the code starts from

naming convention - camel case
class - noun,UpperCase
Interface - Adjective,Uppercase
Method - verb,lowerUpper
variable - noun,lowerUpper
package - lower
constant- upper_upper

method - has a body with some logic to do and it is written for something to avoid repetition of code.

return type - it is a return type that what out method gonna return , if it is null then mention return type as void.

class - blueprint for a object 
object - entity of a class which has parameters and functionality to do

access specifiers-
public - can be accessed from anywhere
private - only with in that class
protected - only with in that package and subchild if it is in different package
default - only in that package

constructor - used to initialise the object
2 types - no arg, parameterized constructor
There are two rules defined for the constructor.
Constructor name must be the same as its class name
A Constructor must have no explicit return type
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

static variable - also called as class variable
static method - class method
this keyword - used to distinguish between local variables(method variables decalred inside a method as parameters) and instance variables (declared inside a class) and also refers to the current object.


inheritance - extends keyword
single,multilevel,heirarchial,hybrid

super and this
this is used to refer to the current object and super is used to the parent class 
we can call var,method,constructor using these keywords.


method overloading - having same method name with different number of parameters or with different data types
method overriding - this is done when inheritance is happening when a child extends its parents method and the child also had the same method then it is overriding that method. we cannot override static method and main also as it is static in nature.
